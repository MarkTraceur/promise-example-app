This is an application with several examples of using promises to
fire Ajax requests, and perform other asynchronous operations.

The backend is not notable, it's a simple web application with a
limited create/fetch system, its API is practically trivial.

The frontend script can be switched out by passing ?useScript=nn,
where nn is a number between 01 and 11. Add more scripts if you like,
or use 00 (or any other undefined number) to see the page without
any JavaScript interference.

To run:
$ git clone https://github.com/MarkTraceur/promise-example-app
$ cd promise-example-app
$ npm install
$ node server

Then go to http://localhost:8888?useScript=01 to see the first
example script.
